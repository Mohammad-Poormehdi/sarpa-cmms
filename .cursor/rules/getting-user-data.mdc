when you want to get the current logged in user data use the isAuthenticated function in [auth.ts](mdc:lib/auth.ts) 
the payload type is like this
```tsx
 const tokenPayload = {
      id: user.id,
      email: user.email,
      name: user.name,
      companyId: user.companyId,
      companyName: user.company.name
    }


```
